Today, we are presenting you our business, ADA, not American Diabetese Association, but simply an acronym for Advertising Asociation.

ADA is made up of a two major components. The Web, and The App. Each of them is very powerful and useful in their own right.

Let us start with the Web, any advertising company who wants to put up an outdoor billboard, come to our website ada.my, sign up and login to our platform.
They request a new permit, we are trying to make the process as smooth as possible, both for advertisers and city councils. Here, they are representing Air Asia to build a billboard, so they just put in some of their basic information, click Next. 
We've simplified this lengthy process into a few steps, also everything is auto-saved into our system and they can be resumed anytime. 

Here in step 2, they fill in the location, the time period where they will have the billboard up and running.
Then, depends on their choice, we’ll ask for the required information to be filled, in most cases, they will want to build the infrastructure themselves, and in this example, they are building it on someone else’s land, they upload the owner permission here, obviously the dimensions and the design they are going to build.
Last step, they put in the company information for the ad, so here’s Air Asia. 

One thing we think that is very important is that we require them to upload the PO of Air Asia. 
Just from this step alone, we can already know how long Air Asia actually pays for their Ad to be up there. 
Just a little tweak like this, we believe it mitigates the problem, of them changing the content w/o City Council permissions.
And, submit the ad design.

Our system automatically sends the request to the City Council for approval.
We’ll get to what City Council will see in a second... but let's say City Council approves the request. 
Now the advertising company has to pay, in order to complete the process.
They pay to us, and once we receive the payment, and from the invoice number, our system knows which request was it, and automatically updates the status, and notifies the company AND the City Council.

Let’s take a look how City Council uses ADA. Under the same platform, you login, you will get to our awesome dashboard for reporting and analysis, but more importantly, remember the permit request for Air Asia? All of them are listed here neatly.

For new permits that require actions, they are always on top, and if you click on it, it brings you to the permit request page. 
Every thing is all here, we even have Google Maps API integrated so that you get to see the street view, and some more information about the location, and also over time, we'll the history of the ads being advertised her, or around here.

City Council will then do the review themselves, this is a highly skilled profession and every city has their own rules and regulations. Right now the approval process takes about 14 days, and once you approve it, like aforementioned, we will ask for the payment automatically and update we'll you immediately.
If they paid, they can start commencing their work on the day they applied for, right?

So whey they finish building their work, they'll notify us, and this brings us to our 2nd component, the app.

---

This ADA app is a community driven app, and it basically handles all the monitoring for us. The concept is rather simple, as a person of the 'community', ADA will send you a task, to go on and check the billboard, and you'll be rewarded with cash.

This is how it works, when an outdoor billboard is up, we periodically send tasks to 5 app users, asking them to go check out a particular billboard at a specific location, when the first 5 of them get there, they tell us if the ad Ada or Tak ada. If they complete the task, they'll get RM 15, straight on. 
Well, if no one actually went there on that day, we'll send to 5 different users the next day.

And we use data and location service to make their lives so much easier to get to those billboards. We also make sure that they can only verify / report if they are WITHIN that area.
There's really not much they need to do, we'll show them the pictures that were taken by your official, when the billboard was set up, on the app. And they just have to compare them with naked eyes. If they are the same, they get RM15, if not the same, they'll get RM150!

Because ADA knows all 2,000 billboards in Penang, so when our user, or anyone really, spotted a weird looking ad, or an ad that they think shouldn't be there, they can just open our app, click explore, it'll show you the all the valid outdoor billboards. If you don't see it here, you can report to us. Just take a picture, and you'll get RM300.

And that was basically our business model.
Prior to that, with our Web platform, each permit we'll charge 10%, we basically take over all the paper work and centralise the whole process.
An outdoor billboard costs about RM100,000 per month, so we'll get 10K from it. 
We'll check each billboard once a month, we need 5 users to verify one billboard one month, RM15 per check, 15 * 5 * 12 months, we only spend RM 540 to ensure the billboard is always valid for a year, the margin is 95%! And over time, our system will learn and we'll not need do as many periodic checks.
On the other side, if ADA is able to report a company that breaks the law, we will get 40% of the fine issued by City Council.

ADA doesn't just give you a tool to manage and monitor, but also a smart system that allows you to oversee everthing, and perdict the market for outdoor billboard advertisements, that eventually turns into more sales.

So hopefully we'll get a deal today with Penang City Council with our web platform and community-driven app.
And who makes up the community? As of right now, we plan to open for all staff of the state goverment, `EXPLAIN_THIS_MORE` 
Aas a start, this gives us a lot of leeway, beacuase they won't be trying to cheat us, most likely. 
Obviously we want to test this more, we're at a rewarding business now, we want to also test if we could gamify it.

Comparing billboards with NO IoT devices is actually vital and is the key selling point here. We are relying the system that we have, the web app, not just solving the headache of the paperwork, but it is a stepping-stone for us to do the monitoring via community.

We all are software engineers, but we compliment each other skillset very well. Myself, Nathan, I'm running my own digital agency, delivering software solutions for various startups and businesses. Jian's running fis own startup, prior to that he worked for a statistical software company in Melbourne, very skilled in big data visualisation and mapping tehcnologies. JY is also a developer, one of the directors of an Australia-based startup, that solves logistic problem using blockchain technologies.

ADA is a sustainable solution for monitoring outdoor billboards by dealing with big data. With the data we gather, we believe we are moving towards the right direction to becoming a Smart City.
