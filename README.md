ADA is made up of a two major components. The Web, and The App. Each of them is very powerful and useful in their own right.

Let us start with the Web, any digital agency who want to put up an outdoor billboard, can come to our website ada.com.my, sign up and login to our platform.
They request a new permit, we are trying to make the process as smooth as possible, both for advertisers and city councils. Here, they are representing Air Asia to create a billboard, so they just put in some of their basic information, click Next. 
We've simplified this lengthly process into a few steps, also everything is auto-saved into our system and they can resume anytime. 

Here in step 2, they fill in the location, the time period where they will have the billboard approved.
Then, depends on their choice, we’ll ask for the required information to be filled, in most cases, they will want to build the infrastructure themselves, and in this example, they are building it on someone’s land, they upload the owner permissions here, obviously the dimensions and the design they are going to build.
Last step, they put in the company information for the ad, so here’s Air Asia. 
One thing we think that is very important is that we require them to upload the PO of the company. 
Just from this step alone, we can already know how long Air Asia actually pays for their Ad to be up there for. 
Just little tweak like this we believe it mitigates the problem of advertising company changes the content by themselves.
And, submit the ad design.

Our system automatically sends the request to the City Council for approval. We’ll get to what City Council will see in a second, but let's say city council approves the request, now the advertising company has to pay in order to complete the process.
And, they pay to us, and once we receive the payment, and from the invoice number, our system knows which request was it and automatically updates the status and notifies the company and City Council.

Let’s take a look how City Council uses ADA. Under the same platform, you login, you will get to our awesome dashboard for reporting and analysis, but more importantly, remember the permit requests by the advertising companies? They are all listed here neatly.
For new permits that require actions, they are always on top, and if you click on it, it brings you to the permit request page. 
Every thing is all here, we even have Google Maps API integrated so that they get to see the street view, and also more information about the location, and also over time, we'll have all of the history of the ads being advertised there, or around there.

City Council will then do the review themselves, this is a highly skilled profession and every city has their own rules and regulations, the approval process will take about 10-14 days, and once they approve it, like aforementioned, we will ask for the payment automatically and update you immediately.
If they paid, they can start commencing their work on the day they applied for, right?

So whey they finish building their work, they'll notify us, and this brings us to our 2nd component, the app.
