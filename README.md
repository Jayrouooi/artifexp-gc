Today, we are presenting you our business, ADA, Advertising Association.

ADA is made up of a two major components. The Web, and The App. Each of them is very powerful and useful in their own right.

Let us start with the Web, here we’re trying to make the process of requesting the permit for putting up billboard as easy as possible, both for advertisers and city council.

So, here, any advertising company who wants to put up an outdoor billboard, come to our website ada.my, sign up and login to our platform. Here, they are representing Air Asia to build a billboard, so they just put in some of their basic information, click Next. 

Here in step 2, they fill in the location, the time period where they will have the billboard up and running.
Then, depends on their choice, we’ll ask for the required information to be filled, in most cases, they will want to build the infrastructure themselves, and in this example, they are building it on someone else’s land, they upload the owner permission here, obviously the dimensions and the design they are going to build.

Last step, they put in the company information for the ad, so here’s Air Asia. 

One thing we think that is very important is that we require them to upload the PO of Air Asia. 
Just from this alone, we already know how long Air Asia is actually paying for their Ad to be up there. Just a little tweak like this, we believe it mitigates the problem, of advertising companies changing the content w/o City Council permissions.
And, submit the ad design.

Let’s take a look how City Council uses ADA. Under the same platform, you login, you will get to our awesome dashboard, kinda for MVP, for reporting and analysis.
Remember the permit request for Air Asia? All of them are listed here neatly.

For new permits that require actions, they are always on top, and if you click on it, it brings you to the permit request page. 
Every thing is all here, we even have Google Maps API integrated so that you get to see the street view, and and also over time, we'll have the history of the ads being advertised her, or around here.

City Council will then do the review themselves, because it is a highly skilled profession and every city has their own rules and regulations. And once you approve it, Ada will ask for the payment automatically. 

Once we receive the payment, and from the invoice number, our system knows which request was it, and automatically updates the status, then notifies the company AND the City Council.

They can start commencing their work on the day they applied for, right?
So whey they finish building their work, they'll notify us, and this brings us to our 2nd component, the app.


---

This is ADA app - a community driven app that help us handles all the monitoring for us.

The concept is simple, as a one of the 'community' members, ADA will send you a task, to go to check the billboard, and you'll be rewarded with cash.

Let's say that, when an outdoor billboard is up, we will send tasks to 5 random app users, asking them to go check out a particular billboard at a specific location.

we'll show them the pictures that were taken by city council official, when the billboard was set up, they just have to compare them with naked eyes. If they are the same, they get RM15 straight on, if not the same, they can report it - once we verify it, they'll get RM150!

We use data and location service to make their lives so much easier to get to those billboards. 

We also make sure that they can only verify / report if they are WITHIN that area. 

Because ADA knows all 2,000 billboards in Penang

so when our user spotted a weird looking ad, or an ad that they think shouldn't be there, they can just open our app, click explore, it'll show you the all the valid outdoor billboards. If you don't see it here, you can report to us. Just take a picture, and you'll get RM300.

And that was basically our business model. 

Prior to that, with our Web platform, each permit we'll charge 10%, we basically take over all the paper work and centralise the whole process. 

If an outdoor billboard costs about RM100,000 per year, so we'll get 10K from it. 

We'll check each billboard once a month, we need 5 users to verify one billboard one month, RM15 per check, 15 * 5 * 12 months, we only spend RM 900 to ensure the billboard is always valid for a year, the margin is 91%! A

On the other side, if ADA is able to report a company that breaks the law, we will get 40% of the fine issued by City Council.

As a start, we plan to open this community driven app to all staff of the state goverment. 

this gives us a lot of leeway, because they most likely won't be trying to cheat us. Obviously we want to test this more, we're at a rewarding business now, we want to also test if we could gamify it.

Monitoring billboards without spending big money is actually vital and the main selling point of our solution. 

By relying on our system, we not just only solving the headache of the paperwork, but it is a stepping-stone for us to do the monitoring via the power of community.

This is just a start. 

Think about it - with the power of the community in our hand, we can not only monitor outdoor billboard, but some other community problems as well like open garbage burning, manhole on the street, or falling tree after a thunderstorm. 

Ultimately, Our goal is build a community driven app that help solved community problem.

We all are software engineers, but we compliment each other skillset very well. Myself, Nathan, I'm running my own digital agency, delivering software solutions for various startups and businesses. Jian's running fis own startup, prior to that he worked for a statistical software company in Melbourne, very skilled in big data visualisation and mapping tehcnologies. JY is also a developer, one of the directors of an Australia-based startup, that solves logistic problem using blockchain technologies.
So hopefully we'll get a deal today with Penang City Council with our web platform and community-driven app.
And who makes up the community? As of right now, we plan to open for all staff of the state goverment, `EXPLAIN_THIS_MORE` 
Aas a start, this gives us a lot of leeway, beacuase they won't be trying to cheat us, most likely. 
Obviously we want to test this more, we're at a rewarding business now, we want to also test if we could gamify it.
